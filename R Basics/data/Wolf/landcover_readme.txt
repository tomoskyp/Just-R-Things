  Description:
    Abstract:
      These data can be used in a geographic information system (GIS) for any
      number of purposes such as assessing wildlife habitat, water quality,
      pesticide runoff, land use change, etc. The State data sets are provided
      with a 300 meter buffer beyond the State border to faciliate combining
      the State files into larger regions.

      The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled and
      the resulting limitations of these data.  The National Land Cover Dataset was
      compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial
      resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where
      available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was
      conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to
      18 Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for
      'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from
      a spatially-broad perspective.  Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see
      below) correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states.
      Thus, the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level.
      The statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region.

      Important Caution Advisory

      With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to
      see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the
      dataset for larger-scale or local analyses.  This evaluation must be made
      remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s.

      The Wyoming portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover mapping
      activities encompassing Federal Region VIII which includes the States of
      Montana, North and South Dakota, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado.
      The NLCD classification contains 21 different land cover
      categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters.  The NLCD was produced
      as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the
      U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce a consistent,
      land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using early 1990s Landsat
      thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the Multi-resolution Land
      Characterization (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership
      of federal agencies that produce or use land cover data.  Partners include
      the USGS (National Mapping, Biological Resources, and Water Resources
      Divisions), US EPA, the U.S. Forest Service, and the National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration.
    Purpose:
      The main objective of this project was to generate a generalized
      and nationally consistent land cover data layer for the entire
      conterminous United States.  These data can be used as a layer in
      a geographic information system (GIS) for any number of purposes
      such assessing wildlife habitat, water quality and pesticide runoff,
      land use change, etc.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The land cover data files are provided as a 'Geo-TIFF'.  The land cover
      data sets are single band raster images.  The X/Y corner coordinates
      (projection coordinates, center of pixel)
      for Wyoming are:
      Upper Left Corner: -1250670/2539890 meters,
      Lower Right Corner: -633450/2027280 meters.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      An accuracy assessment is done on all NLCD on a Federal Region basis
      following a revision cycle that incorporates feedback from MRLC
      Consortium partners and affiliated users.  The accuracy assessments
      are conducted by private sector vendors under contract to the USEPA.
      A protocol has been established by the USGS and USEPA that incorporates
      a two-stage, geographically stratified cluster sampling plan (Zhu et
      al., 1999)utilizing National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP)
      photographs as the sampling frame and the basic sampling unit.  In
      this design a NAPP photograph is defined as a 1st stage or primary
      sampling unit (PSU), and a sampled pixel within each PSU is treated
      as a 2nd stage or secondary sampling unit (SSU).

      PSU's are selected from a sampling grid based on NAPP flight-lines and
      photo centers, each grid cell measures 15' X 15' (minutes of
      latitude/longitude) and consists of 32 NHAP photographs.  A geographically
      stratified random sampling is performed with 1 NAPP photo being randomly
      selected from each cell (geographic strata), if a sampled photo falls
      outside of the regional boundary it is not used.  Second stage sampling
      is accomplished by selecting SSU's (pixels) within each PSU (NAPP photo)
      to provide the actual locations for the reference land cover
      classification.

      The SSU's are manually interpreted and misclassification errors are
      estimated and described using a traditional error matrix as well as a
      number of other important measures including the overall proportion of
      pixels correctly classified, user's and producer's accuracies, and
      omission and commission error probabilities.

      At the time of CD release (Spring, 2001), the accuracy assessment was not
      complete.  For Region VIII accuracy assessment, please check the NLCD
      Website: http://edcwww.usgs.gov/programs/lccp/natllandcover.html.
      The accuracy assessment numbers will be posted there aroung Fall, 2001.

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    An unsupervised classification algorithm was used to classify the
    mosaicked multiple leaf-off TM scenes.  Aerial photographs were
    used to interpret and label classes into land cover categories and
    ancillary data sources resolved the class confusion.  Further land
    cover information from leaf-on TM data, NWI data, and other sources
    were incorporated to refine and augment the "basic" classification.
  Completeness_Report: All photo-interpretable data are mapped.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Each Landsat Thematic Mapper image used to create the NLCD was
        precision terrain-corrected using 3-arc-second digital terrain
        elevation data (DTED), and georegistered using ground control
        points.  This resulted in a root mean square registration error
        of less than 1 pixel (30 meters).

      Process_Description:
        Land Cover Characterization:
        The project is being carried out on the basis of 10 Federal Regions
        that make up the conterminous United States; each region is comprised
        of multiple states; each region is processed in subregional units
        that are limited to the area covered by no more than 18 Landsat TM
        scenes. The general NLCD procedure is to: (1) mosaic subregional TM
        scenes and classify them using an unsupervised clustering algorithm,
        (2) interpret and label the clusters/classes using aerial photographs
        as reference data, (3) resolve the labeling of confused clusters/classes
        using the appropriate  ancillary data source(s), and (4) incorporate
        land cover information from other data sets and perform manual edits to
        augment and refine the "basic" classification developed above.

        Two seasonally distinct TM mosaics are produced, a leaves-on version
        (summer) and a leaves-off (spring/fall) version.  TM bands 3, 4, 5,
        and 7 are mosaicked for both the leaves-on and leaves-off versions.
        For mosaick purposes, a base scene is selected for each mosaic and
        the other scenes are adjusted to mimic spectral properties of the base
        scene using histogram matching in regions of spatial overlap.
        Following mosaicking, either the leaves-off version or leaves-on version
        Is selected to be the "base" for the land cover mapping process.  The 4
        TM bands of the "base" mosaic are clustered to produce a single 100-
        class image using an unsupervised clustering algorithm. Each of the
        spectrally distinct clusters/classes is then assigned to one or more
        Anderson level 1 and 2 land cover classes using National High Altitude
        Photography program (NHAP)and National Aerial Photography program
        (NAPP) aerial photographs as a reference.  Almost invariably, individual
        spectral clusters/classes are confused between two or more land cover
        classes.

        Separation of the confused spectral clusters/classes into appropriate
        NLCD class is accomplished using ancillary data layers.  Standard
        ancillary data layers include: the "non-base" mosaic TM bands and 100-
        class cluster image; derived TM normalized vegetation index (NDVI),
        various TM band ratios, TM date bands; 3-arc second Digital Terrain
        Elevation Data (DTED) and derived slope, aspect and shaded relief;
        population and housing density data; USGS land use and land cover
        (LUDA); and National Wetlands Inventory(NWI) data if available. Other
        ancillary data sources may include soils data, unique state or regional
        land cover data sets, or data from other federal programs such as the
        National Gap Analysis Program (GAP) of the USGS Biological Resources
        Division (BRD).  For a given confused spectral cluster/class, digital
        values of the various ancillary data layers are compared to determine:
        (1) which data layers are the most effective for splitting the
        confused cluster/class into the appropriate NLCD class, and (2) the
        appropriate layer thresholds for making the split(s).  Models are then
        developed using one to several ancillary data layers to split the
        confused cluster/class into the NLCD class.  For example, a population
        density threshold is used to separate high-intensity residential areas
        from commercial/industrial/transportation.  Or a cluster/class might be
        confused between row crop and grasslands.  To split this particular
        cluster/class, a TM NDVI threshold might be identified and used with an
        elevation threshold in a class-splitting model to make the appropriate
        NLCD class assignments.  A purely spectral example is using the
        temporally opposite TM layers to discriminate confused cluster/classes
        such as hay pasture vs. row crops and deciduous forests vs. evergreen
        forests; simple thresholds that contrast the seasonal differences in
        vegetation between leaves-on vs. leaves-off.

        Not all cluster/class confusion can be successfully modeled out.
        Certain classes such as urban/recreational grasses or quarries/strip
        mines/gravel pits that are not spectrally unique require manual editing.
        These class features are typically visually identified and then
        reclassified using on-screen digitizing and recoding.  Other classes
        such as wetlands require the use of specific data sets such as NWI to
        provide the most accurate classification.  Areas lacking NWI data are
        typically subset out and modeling is used to estimate wetlands in these
        localized areas.  The final NLCD product results from the classification
        (interpretation and labeling) of the 100-class "base" cluster mosaic
        using both automated and manual processes, incorporating both spectral
        and conditional data layers.  For a more detailed explanation please
        see Vogelmann et al. 1998 and Vogelmann et al. 1998.

        Discussion:

        While we believe that the approach taken has yielded a very good general
        land cover classification product for the nation, it is important to
        indicate to the user where there might be some potential problems.  The
        biggest concerns are listed below:

        1) Some of the TM data sets are not temporally ideal. Leaves-off data
        sets are heavily relied upon for discriminating between hay/pasture and
        row crop, and also for discriminating between forest classes.  The
        success of discriminating between these classes using leaves-off data
        sets hinges on the time of data acquisition.  When hay/pasture areas are
        non-green, they are not easily distinguishable from other agricultural
        areas using remotely sensed data.  However, there is a temporal window
        during which hay and pasture areas green up before most other vegetation
        (excluding evergreens, which have different spectral properties); during
        this window these areas are easily distinguishable from other crop
        areas. The discrimination between hay/pasture and deciduous forest is
        likewise optimized by selecting data in a temporal window  where
        deciduous vegetation has yet to leaf out. It is difficult to acquire a
        single-date of imagery (leaves-on or leaves-off) that adequately
        differentiates between both deciduous/hay and pasture and hay pasture
        /row crop.

        2) The data sets used cover a range of years (see data sources), and
        changes that have taken place across the landscape over the time period
        may not have been captured.  While this is not viewed as a major problem
        for most classes, it is possible that some land cover features change
        more rapidly than might be expected (e.g. hay one year, row crop the
        next).

        3)  Wetlands classes are extremely difficult to extract from Landsat TM
        spectral information alone.  The  use of ancillary information such as
        National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) data is highly desirable.  We relied
        on GAP, LUDA, or proximity to streams and rivers as well as spectral
        data to delineate wetlands in areas without NWI data.

        4) Separation of natural grass and shrub is problematic. Areas observed
        on the ground to be shrub or grass are not always distinguishable
        spectrally. Likewise, there was often disagreement between LUDA and GAP
        on these classes.

      NLCD Land Cover Classification System Land Cover Class Definitions:

      Water All areas of open water or permanent ice/snow cover.

      11. Open Water - areas of open water, generally with less
      than 25 percent or greater cover of water (per pixel).

      12. Perennial Ice/Snow  - All areas characterized by year-long
      cover of ice and/or snow.

      Developed - areas characterized by high percentage (approximately
      30% or greater) of constructed materials (e.g. asphalt, concrete,
      buildings, etc).

      21. Low Intensity Residential - Includes areas with a mixture of
      constructed materials and vegetation.  Constructed materials account
      for 30-80 percent of the cover. Vegetation may account for 20 to 70
      percent of the cover. These areas most commonly include single-family
      housing units. Population densities will be lower than in high intensity
      residential areas.

      22. High Intensity Residential - Includes heavily built up urban
      centers where people reside in high numbers. Examples include
      apartment   complexes and row houses. Vegetation accounts for less
      than 20 percent of the cover.  Constructed materials account for
      80-100 percent of the cover.

      23. Commercial/Industrial/Transportation - Includes infrastructure
      (e.g. roads, railroads, etc.) and all highways and all developed areas
      not classified as High Intensity Residential.

      Barren - Areas characterized by bare rock, gravel, sad, silt, clay, or
      other earthen material, with little or no "green" vegetation present
      regardless of its inherent ability to support life. Vegetation, if
      present, is more widely spaced and scrubby than that in the
      "green"vegetated categories; lichen cover may be extensive.

      31. Bare Rock/Sand/Clay - Perennially barren areas of bedrock, desert,
      pavement, scarps, talus, slides, volcanic material, glacial debris, and
      other accumulations of earthen material.

      32. Quarries/Strip Mines/Gravel Pits - Areas of extractive mining
      activities with significant surface expression.

      33. Transitional - Areas of sparse vegetative cover (less than 25
      percent that are dynamically changing from one land cover to
      another, often because of land use activities.  Examples include
      forest clearcuts, a transition phase between forest and agricultural land,
      the temporary clearing of vegetation, and changes due to natural causes
      (e.g. fire, flood, etc.)

      Forested Upland - Areas characterized by tree cover (natural or
      Semi-natural woody vegetation, generally greater than 6 meters tall);
      Tree canopy accounts for 25-100 percent of the cover.

      41. Deciduous Forest - Areas dominated by trees where 75 percent
      or more of the tree species shed foliage simultaneously in response to
      seasonal change.

      42. Evergreen Forest -  Areas characterized by trees where 75 percent
      or more of the tree species maintain their leaves all year.  Canopy is
      never without green foliage.

      43. Mixed Forest -  Areas dominated by trees where neither
      deciduous nor evergreen species represent more than 75 percent
      of the cover present.

      Shrubland - Areas characterized by natural or semi-natural woody
      vegetation with aerial stems, generally less than 6 meters tall
      with individuals or clumps not touching to interlocking.  Both evergreen
      and deciduous species of true shrubs, young trees, and trees or shrubs
      that are small or stunted because of environmental conditions are
      included.

      51. Shrubland - Areas dominated by shrubs; shrub canopy accounts
      for 25-100 percent of the cover. Shrub cover is generally greater
      than 25 percent when tree cover is less than 25 percent. Shrub cover
      may be less than 25 percent in cases when the cover of other life forms
      (e.g. herbaceous or tree) is less than 25 percent and shrubs cover
      exceeds the cover of the other life forms.

      Non-natural Woody - Areas dominated by non-natural woody
      vegetation; non-natural woody vegetative canopy accounts for
      25-100 percent of the cover. The non-natural woody classification
      is subject to the availability of sufficient ancillary data to
      differentiate non-natural woody vegetation from  natural woody vegetation.

      61. Orchards/Vineyards/Other - Orchards, vineyards, and other areas
      planted or maintained for the production of fruits, nuts, berries, or
      ornamentals.

      Herbaceous Upland - Upland areas characterized by natural or
      semi- natural herbaceous vegetation;  herbaceous vegetation
      accounts for 75-100 percent of the cover.

      71. Grasslands/Herbaceous - Areas dominated by upland grasses
      and forbs.  In rare cases, herbaceous cover is less than 25 percent,
      but exceeds the combined cover of the woody species present.
      These areas are not subject to intensive management, but they are
      often utilized for  grazing.

      Planted/Cultivated - Areas characterized by herbaceous vegetation
      That has been planted or is intensively managed for the production
      of food, feed, or fiber; or is maintained in developed settings for
      specific purposes. Herbaceous vegetation accounts for 75-100 percent
      of the cover.

      81. Pasture/Hay - Areas of grasses, legumes, or grass-legume mixtures
      planted for livestock grazing or the production of seed or hay crops.

      82. Row Crops -  Areas used for the production of crops, such
      as corn, soybeans, vegetables, tobacco, and cotton.

      83. Small Grains -  Areas used for the production of graminoid
      crops such as wheat, barley, oats, and rice

      84. Fallow - Areas used for the production of crops that are
      temporarily barren or with sparse  vegetative cover as a result of
      being tilled in a management practice that incorporates prescribed
      alternation between cropping and tillage.

      85. Urban/Recreational Grasses - Vegetation (primarily grasses) planted
      in developed settings for recreation, erosion control, or aesthetic
      purposes. Examples include parks, lawns, golf courses, airport grasses,
      and industrial site grasses.

      Wetlands - Areas where the soil or substrate is periodically saturated
      with or covered with water as defined by Cowardin et al.

      91. Woody Wetlands - Areas where forest or shrubland vegetation
      accounts for 25-100 percent of the cover and the soil or substrate
      is periodically saturated with or covered with water.

      92. Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands -  Areas where perennial
      herbaceous vegetation accounts for 75-100 percent of the cover
      and the soil or substrate is periodically saturated with or covered
      with water.
